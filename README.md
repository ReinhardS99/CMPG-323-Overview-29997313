# CMPG-323-Overview-29997313
This will be my overview repository. This repo is the first project as well as a type of management repository for the remaining projects.

## Repositories
Every project that we do this semester will have it's own repository. Thus in this overview a link will be provided below to each project as they are completed.

## Branching strategy
The branching stategy that I will use for all my projects this semester will be the <b>Github Flow</b> strategy. This strategy I can easily create a branch and pull a request when neccessary and merge it back to the main branch when it is deployable. This will come in handy when I need to edit my code without to much struggle and for enabling continuous delivery as much as needed for the programs we will working on. 

For this strategy I will be using a main branch and the development branches with the relevent naming convensions. Thus this will also teach me a lot about version control that is a nesseccary skill in this course.

## .gitignore
The point of a gitignore file is to load in code to the files that you don't want the developer to see. Sensitive information, code and encryprtion and decription keys amoung other things. For my current projects I don't think that I will be using it as we need the markers to see what we are up to. But I will make use of it when nessecary.


## Storage of credentials and Sensitive information
The credentials and Sensitive information will be stored in folders that will be plaged in the gitignore file or will be kept seperate and encrypted. When sensitive dat is transmitted the proper security measures will be taken to keep the data safe one example of this being is also the vpn tranfer to local machine to ensure the best safety measures are in place for the relevant information.
